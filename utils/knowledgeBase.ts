PROPRIETARY SALES METHODOLOGY: PULLED DIRECTLY FROM CONVERSATIONS MADE EASY AND THE CLIENT RETENTION MATRIX BY CHRIS JENNINGS
This response details the primary frameworks and core concepts taught by Chris Jennings, drawing from the sources on *Conversations Made Easy* and *The Client Retention Matrix*. These systems form the repeatable playbook Chris Jennings Group (CJG) implements with clients to drive profitable growth and ensure long-term relationships.

## 1. The "Be Useful Now" (BUN) Framework

The **Be Useful Now** framework is the conversational playbook used to ensure every interaction with a client or prospect is authentic, high-value, and focused on setting clear mutual expectations. It encourages sellers to show up fully ("Be"), focus on being useful, and act immediately ("Now"), replacing pushy scripts with genuine curiosity.

| Letter | Component | Detail and Purpose | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B** | **Before You Go** | Have a plan, prepare mentally and emotionally, and review the customer’s profile to anticipate objections and outcomes. This ensures you start the conversation focused on the customer. | |
| **E** | **Expectations** | Set clear expectations early in the conversation. This involves showing intentional preparation (e.g., researching their company on LinkedIn) and delivering the truth to the client, even if it is difficult, preferably in a "GoLive" dialogue rather than an email. | |
| **U** | **Unique Connections** | Build genuine rapport, often by discussing problems the business solves or finding common ground/shared interests. It involves being honest and direct, avoiding generic "corporate speak". | |
| **S** | **Set an Agenda** | Define and confirm a clear agenda at the start of the meeting to keep the discussion on track and ensure key objectives are met quickly. | |
| **E** | **Explore Their World** | This is the deep discovery phase where you ask questions instead of rushing to solutions. This step uses frameworks like **DECAF** (Details, Elapsed Time, Cost, Effect, Affect/Feel) to fully quantify the client's problem. | |
| **F** | **Finding Time/MONEY/Resources (Fact Finding)** | This phase focuses on confirming the motivation, timing, and resources (similar to BANT: Budget, Authority, Need, Timing). It secures the client's commitment to the required time and money. | |
| **U** | **Understand Who Cares** | Identify all relevant stakeholders and decision-makers. The goal is to understand the internal political landscape ("Who else cares about the work we are doing together?") to prevent misalignment or future sabotage. | |
| **L** | **Let Them Know You** | Assert your credibility and value. Share relevant success stories, testimonials, or case studies, delivered in short, passionate sound bites (30–60 seconds) about what you bring to the table. | |
| **N** | **Next Steps** | Always establish clear and actionable next steps before ending the conversation, maintaining momentum. Agreeing to "call or email later" is insufficient. A date and time for the next meeting must be set. | |
| **O** | **Onboarding** | This is the crucial post-sale step where you implement a structured plan and **train the new customer how to become a great client**. The goal is to "get it right the first time by giving clear direction". | |
| **W** | **What Else Can We Do/Referrals?** | This acts as a catch-all for planting seeds for additional services, cleaning up loose ends, and proactively discussing referrals (see section 3 for detail). | |

## 2. The 10 Systems to Build a Championship Team (Sales Performance)

The sources detail two complementary sets of 10 Systems: one focused on internal **Sales Performance/Playbook** development (often covered in training/Base Camp), and the other focused on **Client Retention** (detailed in section 4).

Here are the ten systems taught to build a championship *sales organization* through internal skills and process development:

1.  **GoLive** (System 1): A measure of **live dialogue** (phone calls, Zoom, face-to-face meetings) with prospects and customers. The objective is to shift interaction away from reliance on email, which loses control of the relationship.
2.  **Sales Playbook** (System 2): The standardized document outlining the entire process, including the 11-step sales conversation, Ideal Client Profile (ICP), and discovery questions.
3.  **Call/Video Recording** (System 3): Implementing a system to record and review calls both individually and as a team, building a library of "great calls" for new hire onboarding and skill development.
4.  **Weekly Sales Practice** (System 4): Structured skill development sessions (not status meetings) where teams drill scenarios like handling price pushback or delayed decision-making, treating sales as a performance sport.
5.  **Scrimmage / Dress Rehearsal** (System 5): Full-length roleplays of sales calls, often filmed and debriefed like game tape, to build confidence and sharpen execution.
6.  **World-Class Onboarding** (System 6): Developing a structured onboarding program for new reps that includes access to recordings, videos, and the playbook *before* Day 1 to establish expectations and momentum.
7.  **Field Rides** (System 7): Sales managers observing reps in live meetings (either as a guide or silent observer) to provide real feedback. The recommended feedback method is 3 compliments and a maximum of 2 areas for improvement.
8.  **Mystery Shop** (System 8): Secret shopping the sales and customer service experience to reveal blind spots, such as reps failing to capture contact information or ask qualifying questions.
9.  **Assessment Tools** (System 9): Utilizing science-based tools like **DISC, Motivators, Skills Inventory,** and **EQ** to screen hires, identify coaching gaps, and understand team dynamics.
10. **Strategic Recruiting** (System 10): Building a recruiting pipeline years in advance, tracking top talent, and maintaining a "Top 10 future hires list" by building trust early with potential recruits.

## 3. Asking for Referrals

Referrals are addressed in the final step of the BUN framework ("What Else Can We Do/Referrals?") and are System 10 of the *Client Retention Matrix*. Chris Jennings teaches that salespeople often fail to get referrals due to fear or lack of a clear playbook.

### Strategic Approach and Language:

*   **Avoid Trigger Words:** Coaches are explicitly warned to **never use the words "referral" or "introduction,"** as they sound "scary".
*   **The Recommended Phrase:** Instead of "referral," use the phrase **"Connect me"** or "Maybe you could connect me to folks that you naturally run into that I would probably never come across without your help".
*   **Sample Conversation Starter:** "As we're working together, if you happen to naturally run into people that need the same kind of help that we offer, I wanted to know if you would be at all open to connecting us?" (The sources estimate the odds of them replying "Sure, happy to do that" are at least 80 percent).

### The Ultimate Referral Strategy (Giving Referrals):

The most powerful strategy is to make your business a **reliable source of business for your clients** so they never leave. This involves System 10 of the Client Retention Matrix: **Referrals to Your Clients**.

*   **Become a Strategic Connector:** Ask the client about other essential service providers they rely on (e.g., best banker, IT partner).
*   **Facilitate Introductions:** Connect the client to other great service providers or clients in your network. If you connect the client to a good banker, and that banker gets a new client, the banker will likely reciprocate by sending you business.
*   **Value Proposition:** This strategy increases equity in the relationship, making the cost of acquiring the new client essentially zero, with limitless long-term payoff.

## 4. Other Core Concepts

### A. The Client Retention Matrix (10 Systems for Lasting Relationships)

This framework is detailed in the book *The Client Retention Matrix* and provides ten repeatable systems focused on nurturing client relationships after the sale, increasing margins, and guaranteeing referrals.

1.  **GoLive:** Continually measure and increase the amount of live dialogue (calls, Zoom, face-to-face) between your team and clients, avoiding default reliance on email.
2.  **Onboarding New Clients:** Beyond administrative setup, this system mandates training new customers to consciously **become ideal clients** by setting clear expectations and rules from Day 1. This prevents problems like scope creep and poor results later.
3.  **Collect Client Org Charts:** Map the client organization to establish relationships with key department heads and multiple stakeholders. This protects the account if a single contact leaves and allows you to find expansion opportunities.
4.  **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs):** Mandate formal, scheduled reviews (every 90 days for top-tier clients) to assess performance against initial expectations. This process positions your business as a partner, not a vendor.
5.  **Update Customer Goals:** Regularly check in on the client's larger company-wide, department-wide, and personal goals to ensure your products/services remain relevant to their evolving priorities.
6.  **Clear Handoffs:** Ensure smooth, systematic transitions between the sales team and the service/implementation/delivery teams ("Special Teams") to prevent communication lapses that lead to client frustration and churn.
7.  **Define Your Ideal Client:** Critically analyze client accounts to identify and prioritize high-profit, low-maintenance "A Clients" while strategically managing or eliminating low-profit, high-maintenance "C Clients".
8.  **Appoint a CXO (Client Experience Officer):** Assign a key leader to strategically manage the client experience and relationship profitability, ensuring the account isn't solely over-managed by the salesperson.
9.  **Contract Renewal & Customer Targets:** Proactively manage renewal conversations early and discuss volume/pricing strategies. Leverage QBRs to reinforce expectations regarding contract goals and expansion.
10. **Referrals to Your Clients:** Actively seek ways to send business or helpful connections *to* your clients, building massive loyalty and reducing the likelihood they will ever leave you.

### B. Core Communication and Mindset Concepts

*   **Humility and Confidence:** The ideal top performer embodies a balance of **humble** (staying teachable and open to feedback) and **confident** (built through consistency and following through on commitments). Selling from a position of wanting to be liked is replaced by becoming a respected peer willing to challenge.
*   **The Problem Statement Pitch:** Frame your value by defining two types of clients or problems you solve, often delivered with humor and empathy ("I’m sure you don’t have these problems, right?") to create instant engagement and break traditional pitching patterns.
*   **The 30-Minute Success Plan (Do Something):** Sales professionals must dedicate a specific, disciplined time block (e.g., 30 minutes daily) for proactive outreach (prospecting, calling, networking) to ensure consistent activity. This relates to the "Chop Wood, Carry Water" principle of consistent, non-reactionary activity.
*   **Lean into Conflict:** Hard conversations should be handled by being assertive, but not aggressive, and always phrasing potential conflicts (e.g., procurement mistakes) from the perspective of how it impacts the client's outcome, not as a personal accusation.
*   **Seek First to Understand:** Utilize deep questioning and approach every new client relationship like solving a **puzzle**, collecting pieces (details) one by one to form the complete picture of their needs and goals. The goal is to make all the unknown factors known.
*   **5S Framework:** A simplified diagnostic tool for explaining growth areas: **Structure, Strategy, Systems, Skills, Staff**.
